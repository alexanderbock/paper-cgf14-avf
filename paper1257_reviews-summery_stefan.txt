- 28.12.2013: authors indicate if they want to re-submit a major revision to CGF (e-mail to holly@acm.org)
- 28.03.2014: submission of major revision
- 28.06.2014: review process expected to be finalized



*** Performance (1)
 * DFB (MCTB12)
 * More GPUs, including ATI
 * Viewpoint dependence? dch
 * Source of speedup: drivers or parallellism
 * Detailed profiling, timers
 * Bigger data and bigger viewports
 
*** Pipeline (2)
 * Clarify LOCAL vs GLOBAL problem (lots of misunderstandings here)
 * Illustrations
 * ppDP description
 * More on actual fusion

*** Text (3)
 * Alternative methods (related work)
 * General transperency (related work)
 * General GPU sorting (related work | later)
 * Perfomance graph (results)
 * Carful with "first time possible" (intro | conslusions)
 * List from Review 5

*** Misc (4)
 * No user study
 * Striking examples
 * Auto-tuning variables
 * Artifacts in rendering/video


 
*1) No user study
*2) Better illustrations
*3) Clear perf. graph notation
*4) Better describe pipeline
*5) Striking examples, big data
*6) Discussions transperency, alternatives
*7) Missunderstanding that we're solving the global problem
*8) Artifacts in rendering/video
*9) Auto-tuning variables
*10) More GPUs (Nvidia and ATI)
*11) "First time possible"
*12) More performance analysis against STAR
*13) Discussion on GPU sorting
*14) DCH viewpoint dependence 
*15) Misunderstanding of gain source (driver vs. parallellism)
